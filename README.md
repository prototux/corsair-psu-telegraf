# corsair-psu-telegraf

Just dropping that here, it's a simple script that parses opencorsairlink's output and generate a influxdb line (or csv) that could be used with telegraf.

Useful for those that wants to monitor a corsair power supply.

Not tested yet, should theorically work, with a HX1000i. The script is simple, hack it.
